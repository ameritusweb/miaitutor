    a) Declarative programming is more focused on the state and behavior of objects.
    b) Declarative programming describes the logic of computation without describing its control flow.
    c) Imperative programming abstracts the flow of control and data more than declarative programming.
    d) Imperative programming allows for less control over the program's state.

Question 4
In declarative programming, which of the following is often less apparent or abstracted away?

    a) The end goal of the program.
    b) The specific steps to achieve the end goal.
    c) The syntax of the language.

Question 5
Which statement is true about HTML in the context of declarative programming?

    a) HTML is used to describe how a webpage should be procedurally generated.

Question 6
What is a common use case for SQL in declarative programming? (Select all that apply)

    a) Creating and manipulating graphical user interfaces.
    b) Querying, updating, and managing databases.
    c) Writing complex algorithms for data analysis.
    d) Describing the layout and style of web pages.

Question 7
What advantage does declarative programming provide in terms of database management?

    a) It requires detailed knowledge of the database's internal workings.
    b) It allows for more direct control over the database's memory and processors.
    c) It enables the expression of the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
    d) It emphasizes how the database should change at each step.
